\title{Main Analysis Function with Double Disaggregation Support}
\usage{
analysis_func(df, ap, multi_response_sep = "; ")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the survey data}

\item{ap}{A data frame specifying the analysis plan with columns:
\itemize{
  \item variable: Column names to analyze
  \item label: Question labels (can include HTML tags like <b>)
  \item kobo_type: Type of question ("select_one", "select_multiple", "integer")
  \item aggregation_method: Method for aggregation ("proportion", "mean", "median", "sum", etc.)
  \item disaggregation: Variable for disaggregation ("all" for no disaggregation)
  \item disagg_label: Labels for disaggregation variables
  \item sheet: Data sheet name (for multi-sheet analysis)
  \item Remarks: Optional notes about the analysis
  \item repeat_for: Optional column for repeat group analysis
}}

\item{multi_response_sep}{Character string specifying the separator for multi-response questions (default: "; ")}
}
\value{
A data frame with analysis results including labels and repeat group information
}
\description{
Main wrapper function that handles analysis plans with support for repeat groups
and double disaggregation. This is the primary function users should call.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage
results <- analysis_func(df = survey_data, ap = analysis_plan)

# With custom multi-response separator
results <- analysis_func(df = survey_data, 
                        ap = analysis_plan, 
                        multi_response_sep = " & ")
